# Simon Game 

Simple memory game. The computer lights up the circles of the rings in ever increasing numbers - starting with one -, where the user has to remember and repeat the computer-generated sequence. If the user gets it right, the score increases and the sequence is increased by one, otherwise the score resets to 0 and a new game starts.

---

The app is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A testing suite is also implemented using the Jest JavaScript library.

---

To install npm packages:
npm install

To run the testing suite:
npm test

Development http server can be started from the terminal:
`python3 -m http.server`
